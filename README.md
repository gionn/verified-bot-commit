A GitHub Action to create signed and verified commits as the
`github-actions[bot]` User with the standard `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or with your own
[GitHub App Token](#github-app-token). This is accomplished via the GitHub [REST
API] by using the [Blob] and [Tree] endpoints to build the commit and update the
original Ref to point to it. [^1]

This Action will stage all changed files in your local branch and add those that
match your file patterns to the commit. Afterwards, your local branch will be
updated to point to the newly created commit, which will be signed and verified
using [GitHub's public PGP key](https://github.com/web-flow.gpg)! Files that
were not committed by the Action will be left staged.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Using this Action with your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] is **not**
> recommended.  
> See [limitations](#limitations) for more details.

> This action supports Linux, macOS and Windows runners (results may vary with
> self-hosted runners).

## Quick Start

```yaml
- name: Commit changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    message: 'feat: Some changes'
    files: |
      README.md
      *.txt
      src/**/tests/*
      !test-data/dont-include-this
      test-data/**
```

## Standalone CLI

The action is also available as a standalone CLI via the
[`@iarekylewoot/verified-bot-commit`](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/pkgs/npm/verified-bot-commit)
package on GitHub Packages.

### CLI Prerequisites

GitHub Packages requires scoped registry configuration before `npx` can resolve
the package. Run once on each machine or CI environment:

```sh
npm config set @iarekylewoot:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

A token with `read:packages` scope is required. In GitHub Actions,
`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` works when the workflow declares `permissions`
with `packages: read`.

### CLI Usage

```sh
npx --yes @iarekylewoot/verified-bot-commit \
  --repository owner/repo \
  --ref main \
  --files "**/*.ts" \
  --message "chore: updates" \
  --token $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

The `--yes` flag is required in non-interactive environments (CI, GitHub
Actions) to skip the install confirmation prompt.

Run `npx @iarekylewoot/verified-bot-commit --help` to see all available
arguments, which mirror the action inputs 1:1.

## Usage

### Inputs

> `List` type is a newline-delimited string

### GITHUB_TOKEN Permissions

This Actions requires the following permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

- `contents: write`

### GitHub App Token

As an alternative to the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, you can use a GitHub App to
generate the necessary token to create _and_ sign the commit instead. This gives
you a nicely signed/verified commit plus all the benefits that using using your
token provide, such as your own bot's name, writing to protected tags/branches,
writing to other repositories, etc.

Refer to the [Use a GitHub App Token](#use-a-github-app-token) example to to
quickly get started with this approach.

For more details, refer to these discussions on the topic:

- [How to Use Commit Signing with GitHub Apps](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50055)
- [GitHub App Installation Token and Authenticating as a GitHub App](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/48186)

## Examples

### Commit all changes

```yaml
- name: Commit & Push changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    message: 'chore: Updates'
    files: |
      **
```

### Commit changes back to a Pull Request

```yaml
- name: Commit & Push changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
    message: 'chore: Update README'
    files: |
      README.md
```

### Ignore warnings when no files changed

```yaml
- name: Commit & Push changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    if-no-commit: info
    message: 'feat: Some changes'
    files: |
      README.md
```

### Creating an empty commit

```yaml
- name: Commit & Push changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    message: 'chore: Empty commit'
    files: '' # don't target any files
    allow-empty-commit: true
```

### Manually stage your own files

```yaml
- name: Stage files
  shell: bash
  run: |
    git add docs/
    git restore --staged docs/something/idont/want

- name: Commit & Push changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    auto-stage: false
    message: 'chore: Updating docs'
    files: |
      docs/**
```

### Use a repository in another directory

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    path: my-repo

- name: Update files
  shell: bash
  run: echo 'Hello World!' > my-repo/test.txt

- name: Commit & Push changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    workspace: my-repo
    message: 'chore: Updating tests'
    files: |
      test.txt
```

### Use a GitHub App Token

```yaml
- name: Create GitHub App Token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
  id: github-app-token
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
    repositories: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}

- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v6
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
    token: ${{ steps.github-app-token.outputs.token }} # Use the App token to checkout

# Other steps that make changes...

- name: Commit & Push changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    message: 'chore: Updating README'
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
    token: ${{ steps.github-app-token.outputs.token }} # Use the App token to commit changes
    files: |
      README.md
      **/README.md
```

## Limitations

⚠️ As always, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to protected Refs.

⚠️ The [Blob] API has a 40MiB limit, any files larger than this in your commit
will fail.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can create a commit with large files using regular git CLI and push it to
> a temporary branch. Then `git log --format=raw` will get you the tree hash,
> which you can use to
> [create a commit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/commits?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-commit)
> with Github API.
> [See example](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50055#discussioncomment-13460641).

⚠️ Using your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] will result in an unsigned and
unverified commit. You should look into using a
[GitHub App Token](#github-app-token), or [using your own keys] and [signing
commits] yourself with the help of Actions like
[webfactory/ssh-agent](https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent) and
[crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg).

## Common Errors

Below are some common errors that can occur depending on your use case. This are
issues that are considered outside the scope of this Action but are still
documented here to include common solutions/workarounds for others.

Feel free to create an
[Issue](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/issues) or
[Pull Request](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/pulls) if you
encounter other errors that should be documented here.

### Git Object Errors

If you see errors that contain
`insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects`
then this probably means another Action in your Workflow performed a local Git
operations as a different user than what the Runner (usually `root`), which
results in `.git/` files being owned by that user.

You can fix this by updating the permissions of the `.git/` directory to the
back to current user/group.

```yaml
- name: Fix .git permissions
  run: sudo chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -g)" .git
```

## Development

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Since this is a TypeScript action you **must** transpile it into native
> JavaScript. This is done for you automatically as part of the `npm run all`
> command and will be validated via the
> [`check-dist.yml`](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions/workflows/check-dist.yml)
> Workflow in any PR.

1. ⚙️ Install the version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) as defined in the
   [`.tool-versions`](.tool-versions).  
   You can use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to help manage your
   project runtimes.

   ```sh
   asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
   asdf install
   ```

2. 🛠️ Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. 🏗️ Format, lint, test, and package your code changes.

   ```sh
   npm run all
   ```

## Releases

For maintainers, the following release process should be used when cutting new
versions.

1. ⏬ Pull down the latest changes and ensure all
   [Workflows](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions) are
   passing.

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. ✅ Bump the package version.

   ```sh
   npm version <major|minor|patch> -m "chore: Bumping version to vX.Y.Z"
   ```

3. 🔖 Create a new Tag, push it up, then create a
   [new Release](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/releases/new)
   for the version.

   ```sh
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push -u origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Alternatively you can create the Tag on the GitHub Release page itself.

   When the tag is pushed it will kick off the
   [Shared Tags](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions/workflows/shared-tags.yml)
   Workflows to update the `v$MAJOR` and `v$MAJOR.MINOR` tags.
